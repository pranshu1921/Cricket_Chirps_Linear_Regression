# Linear Regression on Cricket Chirps 
----------------------------------------------------------
THis repo contains files including Jupyter notebook that containing a walkthrough about using Linear Regression for predicting temperature from the number of chirps from the 'The Song of Insects', by Dr. G. W. Pierce, Harvard College Press, using Linear Regression.

This project is a part of coursework for the course 'Machine LearningA to Z' on Udemy.com.

## General info

In this example we're using the count of chirps per minute as the independent varible to then predict the dependent variable, temperature. In short, we're using a little data science to make ourselves a cricket thermometer. (You could also reverse the data and use temperature to predict the number of chirps, but it's more fun to use crickets as the thermometer itself!)

The methods shown in this example follow what's presented in the Udemy course.

## Setup

* Download the Jupyter Notebook above and the data file (.csv) at the same location on your computer.

### Install the requirements
 
* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    * Make sure you use Python 3.
    
* Run the jupyter notebook

## Status
Project is: Finished

## Inspiration
This project was part of the course ['Machine Learning A-Z'](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-a-ztm-full-course/) on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com), and gave an opportunity to expand my knowledge to working example for Linear Regression machine learning technique.
